## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Development branch (create PRs here)
- `feature/*` - Feature branches
- `fix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates

### Commit Messages

We follow the Conventional Commits specification:

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:

```bash
feat: add Salesforce integration

```

### Code Style

- Use ESLint for JavaScript linting
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test
npm test -- --grep "Apollo"

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Documentation
