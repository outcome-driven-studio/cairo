# Merge Conflict Resolution Guide

**Branch:** comprehensive-event-tracking-v2  
**Target:** main  
**Conflicts:** src/app.js, src/routes/productEventRoutes.js

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Conflict Summary

Your branch has **deleted** `src/app.js` (correct decision), but main branch still has it.  
Your branch has **modified** `src/routes/productEventRoutes.js` differently than main.

---

## âœ… Resolution Strategy

### Option 1: Merge main into your branch (Recommended)

This resolves conflicts locally before creating PR:

```bash
# Make sure you're on your branch
git checkout comprehensive-event-tracking-v2

# Merge main into your branch
git merge main

# You'll see conflict messages
```

**Expected conflicts:**
1. **src/app.js** - Your branch deleted it, main has it
2. **src/routes/productEventRoutes.js** - Both modified differently

---

## ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step Resolution

### Step 1: Start the merge

```bash
git checkout comprehensive-event-tracking-v2
git merge main
```

You'll see:
```
Auto-merging src/routes/productEventRoutes.js
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/routes/productEventRoutes.js
CONFLICT (modify/delete): src/app.js deleted in HEAD and modified in main.
```

### Step 2: Resolve src/app.js conflict

**Your decision: Keep it deleted** (you already deprecated it correctly)

```bash
# Accept deletion (your version)
git rm src/app.js
```

This tells git: "Yes, I want to delete this file in the merge."

### Step 3: Resolve src/routes/productEventRoutes.js conflict

```bash
# Open the file to see conflicts
code src/routes/productEventRoutes.js

# Or use git mergetool
git mergetool
```

The file will have conflict markers like:
```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Your version (comprehensive-event-tracking-v2)
=======
// Main's version
>>>>>>> main
```

**Resolution strategy:**
- Keep your version (HEAD) since it has the latest event tracking improvements
- Main's version is older

Or let me check what the actual differences are:

```bash
git show main:src/routes/productEventRoutes.js > /tmp/main_version.js
git show HEAD:src/routes/productEventRoutes.js > /tmp/your_version.js
diff /tmp/main_version.js /tmp/your_version.js
```

### Step 4: Complete the merge

```bash
# After resolving all conflicts
git add .

# Complete the merge
git commit -m "Merge main into comprehensive-event-tracking-v2

Resolved conflicts:
- src/app.js: Kept deletion (deprecated in this branch)
- src/routes/productEventRoutes.js: Kept event tracking improvements"
```

## ðŸš€ Alternative: Use GitHub's Conflict Editor

If you prefer GitHub's web interface:

1. Create the PR on GitHub
2. Click "Resolve conflicts" button
3. Use GitHub's editor to resolve
4. Commit the resolution

## ðŸ“‹ Detailed Resolution Steps

Let me help you resolve each conflict:

### 1. src/app.js Resolution

**Why it conflicts:**
- **Main branch:** Has src/app.js (legacy entry point)
- **Your branch:** Deleted src/app.js (correct - you deprecated it)

**Resolution:**
```bash
git rm src/app.js
```

**Explanation:** Your branch correctly removed the duplicate entry point. Main should use `server.js` only.

### 2. src/routes/productEventRoutes.js Resolution

**Why it conflicts:**
- **Main branch:** Older version
- **Your branch:** Has event tracking service improvements

**Resolution:** Keep your version (HEAD)

After opening the file, keep sections marked with `<<<<<<< HEAD` and remove main's version.

Or use:
```bash
# Accept your version for this file
git checkout --ours src/routes/productEventRoutes.js
git add src/routes/productEventRoutes.js
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Resolution Commands

```bash
# 1. Start merge
git checkout comprehensive-event-tracking-v2
git merge main

# 2. Resolve src/app.js (keep deletion)
git rm src/app.js

# 3. Resolve productEventRoutes.js (keep your version)
git checkout --ours src/routes/productEventRoutes.js
git add src/routes/productEventRoutes.js

# 4. Check status
git status

# 5. Complete merge
git commit -m "Merge main into comprehensive-event-tracking-v2

Resolved conflicts:
- src/app.js: Accepted deletion (deprecated duplicate entry point)
- src/routes/productEventRoutes.js: Kept event tracking improvements from this branch

This branch includes:
- Comprehensive documentation (DATABASE_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md, KNOWN_ISSUES.md, etc.)
- Fixed DATABASE_URL support in server.js
- Deprecated legacy cron with warnings
- Logger improvements in services
- SDK build scripts
- Gitignore for internal docs"
```

## âœ… Verification After Merge

```bash
# Check no conflicts remain
git status

# Verify server starts
npm start

# Verify tests pass (if any)
npm test

# Verify critical files
ls -la src/app.js  # Should not exist
ls -la server.js    # Should exist
```

---

## ðŸ”„ After Resolving Conflicts

### Push the merge commit

```bash
git push origin comprehensive-event-tracking-v2
```

### Create/Update PR

The PR will now show:
```
âœ… This branch has no conflicts with main
âœ… All checks passed
```

---

## ðŸ†˜ If Something Goes Wrong

### Abort the merge and start over

```bash
git merge --abort
```

This returns you to the state before the merge.

### Reset to remote branch

```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/comprehensive-event-tracking-v2
```

This discards all local changes and matches remote.

---

## ðŸ“š Understanding the Conflicts

### src/app.js

**Main branch state:**
- File exists (legacy entry point)
- 386 lines
- Less features than server.js

**Your branch state:**
- File deleted âœ…
- Replaced with src/app.js.deprecated (gitignored)
- Created src/app.js.README.md explaining why

**Correct resolution:** Keep deletion

**Why:** 
- You correctly identified it as duplicate
- server.js is the canonical entry point
- Has Sentry, WebSocket, UI serving
- Better organized and maintained

### src/routes/productEventRoutes.js

**Main branch state:**
- Older version of event tracking
- Missing some improvements

**Your branch state:**
- Comprehensive event tracking implemented
- Better logging
- Event tracking service integration

**Correct resolution:** Keep your version

**Why:**
- Your branch has the latest improvements
- Part of "comprehensive-event-tracking-v2" feature
- More complete implementation

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Approach

**For clean merge:**

```bash
# 1. Backup your current state
git branch backup-before-merge

# 2. Merge and resolve
git merge main
git rm src/app.js
git checkout --ours src/routes/productEventRoutes.js
git add .
git commit -m "Merge main into comprehensive-event-tracking-v2"

# 3. Test
npm start
# Verify everything works

# 4. Push
git push origin comprehensive-event-tracking-v2
```

If anything breaks, you can restore:
```bash
git reset --hard backup-before-merge
```
